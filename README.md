## Implementation
This project implements the following features:
1. RRR type robot on a prismatic joint gantry with electromagnetic end effector to play tic tac toe game
2. Dynamixel Servos used to control the 3D printed joints and links designed in Solidworks
3. Verification of Forward and Inverse Kinematics, and game flow code in MATLAB.
4. Successful hardware implementation.
5. Report writing and creating videos to summarise the findings.
